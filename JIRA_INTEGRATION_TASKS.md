# Jira Integration Implementation Tasks

This document outlines the tasks needed to implement Jira integration in the Stories & QA interface.

## Research & Architecture

### 1. Research existing Jira integration patterns in codebase
- [ ] Search for any existing Jira API usage or third-party integrations
- [ ] Review authentication patterns used in the project
- [ ] Analyze current API client architecture in backend

### 2. Design Jira API integration architecture and authentication flow
- [ ] Design authentication strategy (API tokens, OAuth, basic auth)
- [ ] Plan API client structure and error handling
- [ ] Design configuration storage and management
- [ ] Plan rate limiting and request queuing strategy

## Core Implementation

### 3. Create Jira configuration UI in Stories & QA interface
- [ ] Add Jira settings section to Stories & QA page
- [ ] Create forms for Jira URL, credentials, and project configuration
- [ ] Add connection testing functionality
- [ ] Implement settings persistence (local storage or backend)

### 4. Implement backend Jira API client with authentication
- [ ] Create Jira API client class with authentication methods
- [ ] Implement basic CRUD operations for issues and projects
- [ ] Add configuration management and credential handling
- [ ] Create API response models using Pydantic

### 5. Add Jira project and issue type selection functionality
- [ ] Fetch available Jira projects from user's instance
- [ ] Retrieve issue types and custom fields for selected project
- [ ] Create UI dropdowns for project and issue type selection
- [ ] Implement field mapping configuration

### 6. Create story-to-Jira mapping logic (epic creation, story creation, linking)
- [ ] Map generated epics to Jira epic issue type
- [ ] Map user stories to Jira story/task issue types
- [ ] Implement parent-child linking between epics and stories
- [ ] Handle acceptance criteria and description formatting

### 7. Implement bulk story export to Jira with progress tracking
- [ ] Create batch export functionality with progress indicators
- [ ] Implement export queue management
- [ ] Add success/failure status tracking per story
- [ ] Create export summary and error reporting

## Advanced Features

### 8. Add Jira ticket status synchronization and updates
- [ ] Implement periodic status checking for exported tickets
- [ ] Update local story status based on Jira ticket status
- [ ] Add visual indicators for sync status in UI
- [ ] Handle status conflicts and manual resolution

### 9. Create error handling and retry logic for Jira API failures
- [ ] Implement exponential backoff for API rate limits
- [ ] Add comprehensive error messaging and user feedback
- [ ] Create retry mechanisms for failed exports
- [ ] Handle authentication expiration and renewal

### 10. Add Jira integration testing and validation
- [ ] Create unit tests for Jira API client
- [ ] Add integration tests with mock Jira responses
- [ ] Test authentication flow and error scenarios
- [ ] Validate story mapping and export functionality

### 11. Update Stories & QA UI with Jira export buttons and status indicators
- [ ] Add export buttons to epic and story components
- [ ] Implement export status badges and progress indicators
- [ ] Create export history and tracking panel
- [ ] Add bulk selection and export controls

### 12. Implement Jira webhook integration for bidirectional sync
- [ ] Set up webhook endpoint in backend for Jira events
- [ ] Handle ticket updates, status changes, and comments
- [ ] Implement real-time sync of changes back to Stories & QA
- [ ] Add webhook security and validation

## Technical Considerations

### Dependencies
- **Jira REST API**: Use Atlassian REST API v3 for modern integration
- **Authentication**: Support for API tokens, OAuth 2.0, and basic auth
- **HTTP Client**: Leverage existing HTTP client or add requests/httpx
- **WebSocket Updates**: Real-time sync updates through existing WebSocket system

### Security
- **Credential Storage**: Secure storage of API keys and tokens
- **HTTPS Required**: Enforce secure connections to Jira instances
- **Input Validation**: Sanitize all user inputs and API responses
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect Jira API rate limits and implement backoff

### Performance
- **Async Operations**: Use async/await for all Jira API calls
- **Caching**: Cache Jira metadata (projects, issue types) to reduce API calls
- **Batch Operations**: Group related API calls to minimize requests
- **Progress Feedback**: Real-time progress updates for long-running exports

### User Experience
- **Configuration Wizard**: Step-by-step setup for first-time users
- **Export Preview**: Show what will be created in Jira before export
- **Status Dashboard**: Clear visibility into export status and errors
- **Rollback Capability**: Option to undo or modify exported items

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Users can configure Jira connection with their instance
- [ ] Generated epics and stories can be exported to Jira with proper linking
- [ ] Export process provides clear progress and error feedback
- [ ] Bidirectional sync keeps Stories & QA interface in sync with Jira
- [ ] Integration handles errors gracefully with retry mechanisms
- [ ] All functionality is thoroughly tested and documented
