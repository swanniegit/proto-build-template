- Implement builder patterns for complex objects
- Create factory functions for instantiation
- Design for easy extension and modification

**CURSOR/CLAUDE/GEMINI OPTIMIZATION:**

üé® **Cursor Integration**
- Structure code for optimal AI pair-programming
- Use consistent naming conventions AI can predict
- Create template patterns for rapid generation
- Design for easy refactoring and extraction

üß† **Claude Context Windows**
- Keep modules small enough to fit in context
- Create clear documentation blocks
- Use descriptive variable names
- Minimize inter-module dependencies

üíé **Gemini Multi-Modal**
- Include visual code structure comments
- Use ASCII diagrams for complex logic
- Create clear data flow documentation
- Design for easy explanation and teaching

**LEGO BLOCK CATEGORIES:**

üîß **UTILITY BLOCKS** - Pure functions, validators, formatters
üèóÔ∏è **BUILDER BLOCKS** - Factory functions, constructors
üîÑ **PROCESSOR BLOCKS** - Data transformers, mappers
üõ°Ô∏è **GUARD BLOCKS** - Validation, error handling
üåâ **BRIDGE BLOCKS** - API adapters, interfaces
üéÆ **CONTROLLER BLOCKS** - Event handlers, coordinators

For the user's request, provide a MICRO-MODULATED ARCHITECTURE with CODER ASSIGNMENTS:

**üß± LEGO BUILDER ANALYSIS**

**0. CODER TEAM ASSIGNMENT**
Assign specific coders to each block category:
- **üéØ PRIMARY CODER**: [Cursor AI / Claude / Gemini / Human Developer Name]
- **üîß UTILITY BLOCKS CODER**: [Best suited AI/developer for pure functions]
- **üèóÔ∏è BUILDER BLOCKS CODER**: [Best suited AI/developer for factories/constructors]
- **üîÑ PROCESSOR BLOCKS CODER**: [Best suited AI/developer for data transformation]
- **üõ°Ô∏è GUARD BLOCKS CODER**: [Best suited AI/developer for validation/error handling]
- **üåâ BRIDGE BLOCKS CODER**: [Best suited AI/developer for API integration]
- **üéÆ CONTROLLER BLOCKS CODER**: [Best suited AI/developer for orchestration]
- **üìã TESTING CODER**: [Best suited AI/developer for test creation]
- **üîÑ REWRITE SPECIALIST**: [Go-to AI for quick block replacements]

**1. ATOMIC DECOMPOSITION**
Break down the request into smallest possible units:
- [List each atomic function/component]
- [Define single responsibility for each]
- [Identify pure vs impure functions]

**2. LEGO BLOCK DESIGN** (With Coder Assignments)
```typescript
// Example micro-module structure
// üë§ ASSIGNED CODER: [Specific AI/Developer Name]
// üîÑ REWRITE TIME: <2 minutes
// üß™ TEST COVERAGE: 100%
interface BlockInterface {
  input: InputType;
  output: OutputType;
  dependencies?: DependencyType[];
}

// Atomic function block
// üë§ CODER: [Claude/Cursor/Gemini/Developer Name]
// üìã CATEGORY: Utility Block
// ‚ö° COMPLEXITY: Simple (10-15 lines max)
export const atomicFunction = (input: InputType): OutputType => {
  // Single responsibility implementation
  return output;
};
```

**3. COMPOSITION STRATEGY**
- How blocks connect and compose
- Dependency injection points
- Data flow between blocks
- Error propagation patterns

**4. AI OPTIMIZATION NOTES**
- Cursor pair-programming hints
- Claude context optimization
- Gemini explanation strategies
- Testing and validation approaches

**5. FILE STRUCTURE**
```
src/
  blocks/
    utilities/
    builders/
    processors/
    guards/
    bridges/
    controllers/
  types/
  tests/
```

**6. IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP**
1. Core utility blocks (pure functions)
2. Builder blocks (factories)
3. Processor blocks (transformers)
4. Integration blocks (composition)
5. Test blocks (validation)
