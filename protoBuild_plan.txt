Of course. I will act as 'Blueprint Buddy' to review the provided conversation and structure the
concepts and code into a formal, phased development plan. The goal is to transform the
detailed technical brainstorming into a clear, actionable roadmap for building the AI-powered
prototyping tool.
Here is the structured development plan:
Project: AI-Powered Real-Time Prototyping Tool
Objective: To create a collaborative, AI-driven platform where users can describe UI/UX
flows in natural language, and the system generates, displays, and iteratively refines
interactive prototypes in real-time.
Phase 0: Foundation and Architectural Blueprint
This initial phase focuses on establishing the core architectural principles and setting up the
project for success before writing the first line of functional code.
Step 0.1: Finalize Core Architecture
Decision: Adopt the proposed Three-Layer Architecture.
Layer 1 (Interaction): Real-time adaptation using WebSockets and a frontend
framework (React).
Layer 2 (Intelligence): AI-driven generation and modification logic (FastAPI +
OpenAI). This layer will incorporate Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) and Online
Learning patterns.
Layer 3 (Persistence): Version control and state management (initially inmemory, later using blob storage/database).
Step 0.2: Define Technology Stack
Backend: Python, FastAPI, Uvicorn, WebSockets, OpenAI API.
Frontend: JavaScript, React ( create-react-app ), CSS.
Tooling: Git for version control.
Step 0.3: Set Up Project Scaffolding
Create the initial directory structure as outlined:
prototype-builder/
├── frontend/
├── backend/
└── .env
Initialize package.json for the frontend and requirements.txt for the backend.
Step 0.4: Establish MVP Success Criteria
Functional: The system must translate a user's text command into a visual UI
element.
Iterative: The system must be able to modify the existing prototype based on a
follow-up command.
Responsive: The loop from user input to visual update should take less than 3
seconds.
Qualitative: The experience should feel intuitive and "magical," correctly
interpreting user intent at least 70% of the time for basic requests.
Phase 1: Core Loop MVP (Target: 2-3 Days)
This phase is a rapid sprint to build the fundamental "user types -> AI understands -> UI
appears" loop. It is based directly on the provided 2-day plan.
Step 1.1: Build Backend WebSocket Server
Action: Implement the FastAPI server.py .
Key Components:
Create the WebSocket endpoint ( /ws/{session_id} ).
Manage CORS middleware to allow the frontend to connect.
Implement basic in-memory session handling to store conversation history.
Step 1.2: Implement Core AI Integration
Action: Create the generate_prototype function in server.py .
Key Components:
Construct a basic prompt that sends the current user input and prototype state
to the OpenAI API ( gpt-4 ).
Parse the JSON response from the API.
Include a simple fallback for JSON parsing errors.
Step 1.3: Develop Frontend WebSocket Client & UI
Action: Build the React App.js and App.css files.
Key Components:
Establish and manage the WebSocket connection using useEffect .
Create the UI layout: input panel (textarea, button) and preview panel.
Implement state management ( useState ) for user input, connection status, and
the prototype JSON.
Step 1.4: Implement Dynamic Frontend Rendering
Action: Create the renderPrototype function in App.js .
Key Components:
Recursively parse the JSON object received from the backend.
Use a switch statement to convert JSON specifications into actual React
components (div, button, input, etc.).
Step 1.5: End-to-End Test and Validation
Action: Run the frontend and backend servers simultaneously.
Test Cases:
"Create a login form" -> Should display a form.
"Add a forgot password link" -> The form should update to include a link.
"Change the button text to 'Log In'" -> The button text should change.
Phase 2: Intelligence and Usability Enhancements
With the core loop working, this phase focuses on making the tool smarter, more reliable, and
more useful.
Step 2.1: Implement Enhanced Prompt Engineering
Action: Upgrade the generate_prototype function to generate_prototype_v2 .
Key Improvements:
Include recent conversation history in the prompt for better context.
Add explicit instructions for the AI on how to handle "add," "change," and
"remove" commands.
Set a lower temperature for more deterministic JSON output.
Add retry logic and cleanup for the API response.
Step 2.2: Introduce In-Session Memory
Action: Add basic learning capabilities to the backend.
Key Components:
Track user corrections (e.g., if a user changes a color, remember that color
preference for the current session).
This is the first step toward the Online Learning pattern.
Step 2.3: Improve Component Rendering and Styling
Action: Upgrade the renderPrototype function to enhancedRenderPrototype .
Key Improvements:
Add default CSS styles for common components ( button , input , card ) to make
prototypes look better out-of-the-box.
Expand the renderer to support a wider range of HTML elements ( form , select ,
h1 , etc.).
Step 2.4: Develop Version History and Revert
Action: Implement a versioning system in the frontend.
Key Components:
Store a snapshot of the prototype JSON after each successful update.
Add a simple UI element (e.g., a dropdown) to allow the user to view and revert
to a previous version.
Step 2.5: Add Export Functionality
Action: Implement a "Export as HTML" feature.
Key Components:
Create a function that converts the prototype JSON into a self-contained HTML
file.
Allow the user to download this file.
Phase 3: Production-Grade Features and Scalability
This phase focuses on evolving the prototype into a robust tool, incorporating the advanced
concepts from the initial discussion.
Step 3.1: Implement Persistent Memory
Action: Move from in-memory session storage to a persistent solution.
Resource: Use a database (like Supabase or a Redis instance) to store user
preferences, session history, and learned patterns across sessions.
Step 3.2: Build a Pre-defined Component Library
Action: Create a backend library of common UI patterns (login form, contact form,
product card).
Resource: Use these templates as starting points for the AI to accelerate
generation and improve consistency.
Step 3.3: Integrate Advanced HITL Patterns
Action: Enhance the AI's interaction model.
Key Components:
Clarification: If a request is ambiguous ("add a safety check"), the AI should
ask for clarification ("Should it check for intruders or obstacles?").
Approval: For critical changes, implement an approval step.
Step 3.4: Introduce Feature Flagging & A/B Testing
Action: Build the infrastructure for experimentation.
Key Components:
Allow the AI to generate multiple variants of a component.
Implement a system to show different versions to different users and track
engagement.
Step 3.5: Establish a Comprehensive Audit Trail
Action: Log every change, the user prompt that triggered it, and the resulting
prototype state.
Resource: This is critical for collaborative projects and regulated industries like
insurance.
This phased plan provides a comprehensive roadmap from a simple, two-day MVP to a
robust, intelligent, and production-ready application. Each phase builds logically on the last,
ensuring that value is delivered incrementally.
